<h1>Horror Stories,For your goosebumps</h1>
<h1>### 1. The Weeping Boy</h1>

<p>The crying started on the third night. David had just finished unpacking the last box in the master bedroom when he heard it—a muffled, hiccuping sob coming from *inside* the wall. "Pipes," his wife, Clara, had murmured, half-asleep.

But the sound was too human.

He pressed his ear to the vintage wallpaper. The sobbing was distinct, punctuated by tiny, desperate gasps. He called a plumber, who checked the radiators and declared them sound. He called a contractor, who studied the 1920s blueprints.

"Well, that's odd," the contractor said, tapping a spot on the print. "According to this, there's a four-foot void right here. Not a closet, not part of the chimney. Just... empty space."

That night, the crying was louder. David, armed with a crowbar, couldn't take it anymore. He ripped away the plaster and lath, revealing a small, dark space, barely the size of a cabinet. It was empty, except for a thick layer of dust and a single, child-sized shoe.

He shined his flashlight into the darkness. The crying had stopped.

"Hello?" David whispered.

A cold, dusty puff of air hit his face. From the darkness of the void, a small, childlike voice whispered back, "Thank you. I was so lonely." David felt a small, icy hand slip into his own.</p>

<h1>### 2. The Placeholder</h1>

<p>Mark slid his key into the lock. "Honey, I'm home!" he called. The flight from Tokyo had been brutal.

His wife, Sarah, came from the kitchen, wiping her hands on an apron. "Welcome back, darling." She kissed him. Her lips were dry. He frowned. She always wore cherry chapstick.

"How was the trip?" she asked, her voice perfectly modulated.
"Long," he said, loosening his tie. "Where's Leo?"
"In his room. Doing homework," she replied, smiling.

Something about her smile was wrong. It didn't reach her eyes. In fact, her eyes, usually a warm hazel, looked flat. Lifeless.

He went upstairs. His son, Leo, was at his desk. "Hey, bud. Miss me?"
Leo turned, his posture perfectly straight. "Hello, Father. Your trip was successful, I trust? I have completed my algebra assignment."

Mark’s blood ran cold. *Father?* Leo never called him "Father." He always said "Dad." And Leo *hated* algebra.

Mark backed away, looking at the two of them standing in the hallway, smiling identical, placid smiles. "What's going on?" he whispered.

"We're your family, Mark," Sarah said, stepping forward. "We've just... tidied up. We're so much better now."</p>

<h1>### 3. Don't Look in the Reflection</h1>

<p>Eliza loved the antique mirror. It was a massive, floor-standing oval with a frame of carved mahogany. She placed it in the corner of her bedroom, opposite the bed.

The first time it happened, she thought it was a trick of the light. She'd crossed the room to get her jewelry, and in the reflection, she saw her own back, still sitting on the bed for a split second *after* she had stood up.

It was a mirror with a delay. A one-second lag. It was quirky, a novelty.

Then the lag grew longer. Five seconds. Ten. She would be brushing her teeth, and her reflection would still be wiping its face.

One night, she woke up, parched. She sat up in bed and glanced at the mirror. Her reflection was still lying down, fast asleep. Eliza stared, her heart hammering. As she watched, the eyes of her reflection slowly opened. They weren't her eyes. They were dark, ancient, and filled with a hungry malice. The reflected Eliza smiled, a wide, predatory grin, and slowly began to sit up.</p>

<h1>### 4. The Sitter and the Swing</h1>

<p>It was an easy gig. The kids, Liam and Mia, were quiet and polite. As dusk settled, Sarah, the babysitter, sat on the couch, reading a magazine while the children played with blocks.

She glanced out the glass patio door. The backyard was dark, but the porch light illuminated the old wooden swing set. One swing was moving. Back... and forth. Back... and forth. Rhythmic, steady.

"Is the wind picking up?" she asked idly.

Liam didn't look up from his blocks. "No. That's just Emily."
Sarah chuckled. "Oh? Who's Emily? A friend?"
"Our sister," Mia said, stacking a red block on a blue one.
"Oh, I'm sorry, your mom didn't mention a third..."
"She's not allowed in the house anymore," Liam said, his voice flat. "She got sick. The man in the ground was very clear."

Sarah stared at the children. "The... the man in the ground?"
Mia nodded. "He said she has to stay outside now. But she likes the swing."
The swinging outside stopped abruptly. A second later, a small, pale face pressed against the glass of the patio door, its dark eyes fixed on Sarah.</p>

<h1>### 5. The Man in the Static</h1>

<p>enna found the television in the attic of her new apartment building. A 1970s "Zenith" with rabbit-ear antennas. She plugged it in for fun, a retro novelty.

It only picked up one channel. Not a station, just... a broadcast.

It was a grainy, black-and-white feed of a man sitting in a simple wooden chair. He was gaunt, in a dark suit, and he just... sat. Staring directly at the camera. At *her*.

She'd leave it on as background noise. The unchanging, buzzing image was almost comforting.

One night, after a terrible date, she slumped on the couch, wine glass in hand. "You're lucky," she slurred at the man on the screen. "You don't have to deal with any of this."

The man on the screen nodded. Once. Slowly.

Jenna sobered instantly. She sat bolt upright, staring.
"W-what?"
The man leaned forward, his face filling the screen. The static grew louder, a sound like a million dry insects. He raised a hand, pressing his palm flat against the *inside* of the glass. Then, slowly, with a sound like wet gravel, he stood up.

The glass of the old television screen began to bulge outward.</p>

<h1>### 6. The Hunger</h1>

<p>It was just a scratch. That's what Dr. Evans had told him. A simple scratch from a raccoon or a possum while he was camping. He got the rabies shot and forgot about it.

A week later, the hunger started.

It wasn't a normal hunger. It was a deep, gnawing, hollow ache in his gut that no amount of food could fill. He'd eat a whole pizza and feel famished.

Then, the cravings began. He'd be at his desk, and the smell of his coworker's perfume would make his mouth water in a way that was both disgusting and thrilling. He started staring at people on the subway, not at their faces, but at the throb of the vein in their necks, the soft, unprotected skin of their wrists.

One night, his cat, Mittens, rubbed against his leg. He looked down, and all he could see was a small, warm, pulsing *thing*. His gums ached. His vision went red at the edges.

He woke up hours later on his kitchen floor, his mouth sticky and coppery. The hunger was gone. For the first time in days, he felt full.
He called for Mittens. The apartment was silent.</p>

<h1>### 7. The Grinning Man</h1>

<p>It started in crowds. In the periphery of her vision, amongst the throng of people on her morning commute, she’d see him: a tall man in a dated brown suit, smiling. The grin was the thing. It was unnaturally wide, splitting his face from ear to ear, showing too many teeth.

When she tried to look at him directly, he'd be gone.

Then, she saw him on empty streets. She’d be walking home at night and see him standing under a flickering streetlight a block away, grinning that same, impossible grin.

She started taking taxis. She locked her doors. She drew her blinds.

It didn't help. She was washing dishes, her back to the window. In the faint reflection of the dark glass, she saw him. He was standing in her kitchen, right behind her.

She didn't dare turn around. She just stood, paralyzed, watching his reflection in the window. He slowly raised a hand and waved, his grin stretching wider, the skin at the corners of his mouth starting to tear.</p>

<h1>## 8. The 3:33 AM Lullaby</h1>

<p>The baby monitor was a godsend for new parents, Mark and Chloe. Until 3:33 AM.

The first time, Chloe assumed she'd dreamt it. A faint, tinny melody from the monitor. It wasn't the white noise machine. It was a lullaby, but the tune was discordant, sinister, and full of static.

It happened again the next night. 3:33 AM, on the dot. The lullaby played.
Chloe watched the video feed. Her son, Ben, was wide awake. He wasn't crying. He was standing up in his crib, staring at the far corner of the room, just out of the camera's view.

On the third night, Mark was waiting. At 3:32 AM, he crept into Ben's room and hid in the closet.
3:33 AM. The monitor on the nightstand crackled to life. The lullaby began.
Mark watched, his blood freezing. Ben stood up, as expected. He stared at the empty corner.

"Hello?" Ben gurgled, a sound he'd never made before.
From the monitor, a new sound came. A low, wet, breathy voice. "Hello, Benjamin. Did you like the song? I'll sing you another if you come closer."
Mark watched, horrified, as something long and pale, like a finger made of shadow, slithered from the AC vent in that corner.</p>

<h1>### 9. The Crawl</h1>

<p>The rash started on his forearm, just a patch of red, itchy skin. He assumed it was poison ivy. But the calamine lotion did nothing.

The itch changed. It wasn't a surface itch. It was *under* the skin. It was a tickle. It was a... movement.

He would be lying in bed, and he'd see it: a small, worm-like ridge moving in a zig-zag pattern up his arm. He'd slap it, and it would stop, only to resume moments later near his elbow.

He went to the hospital. The doctor, a young intern, shined a bright light on his arm. "I... I don't see anything, Mr. Harris. The skin isn't even broken."
"Look!" Harris hissed, pointing. "There! It's moving!"
The doctor's eyes widened. He saw it. A faint undulation beneath the skin, moving toward Harris's shoulder.

They prepped him for an emergency biopsy. As the surgeon approached with a scalpel, the movement under Harris's skin became frantic. It wasn't one thing. It was hundreds. They all began crawling at once, a writhing mass, moving away from his arm and *toward his neck*.

"It's in my throat!" he choked, as the surgeon watched, horrified, as the skin on Harris's neck began to ripple and writhe.</p>

<h1>### 10. The Wrong House</h1>

<p>"Here you are, 1428 Elm," Greg, the rideshare driver, said.
The passenger, a quiet man in a hat, grunted, paid in cash, and got out. Greg pulled away, but a block later, he heard the *ding* of a phone. He looked at the backseat. A new iPhone.

"Damn it," he muttered. He made a U-turn and pulled back up to 1428 Elm. The house was dark, the porch light off. The passenger must have gone right inside.

Greg got out, walked up the cracked pathway, and rang the bell.
A moment later, the door creaked open. An elderly woman in a nightgown peered out.
"Sorry to bother you," Greg said. "My last passenger just left his..."
"Oh, goodness," the woman smiled, her eyes unnervingly bright. "You're just in time. We were waiting for you."
"Waiting for me? I'm just..."
"He's here!" the woman called into the dark house. "The guest has arrived!"

Greg heard a shuffling from inside. Several sets of feet. A man in a hat—*not* his passenger—appeared behind the woman.
"Come in, come in," the man said, his smile all gums. "The table is set. We're so glad you decided to join us."

The man grabbed Greg's wrist. His grip was like iron.</p>
